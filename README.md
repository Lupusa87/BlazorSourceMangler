**App is not tested (!!!) for latest commit and is not in active development.**

This is .net core console app which is processing blazor dlls (only blazor app and blazor lib dlls, not common dlls like mscorlib) and is mangling property/field/parameter/method/type/namespace names and cleaning dead codes.

Purpose is to make downloaded blazor dlls smaller and less readable for foreign eyes.

Also shortening names is giving some additional dll's size reducion.

App is using mono.cecil.
